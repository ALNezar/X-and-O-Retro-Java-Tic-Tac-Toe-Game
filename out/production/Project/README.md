1.  **Download or clone this project:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/ALNezar/X-and-O.git](https://github.com/ALNezar/X-and-O.git)
    cd X-and-O
    ```

2.  **Run the game:**
    * **If you use an IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse):**
        Open the project and run `Main.java` directly. The IDE will automatically handle the necessary dependencies.
    * **If you use the command line:**
        You need to include the SQLite JDBC driver (`sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar`) in your classpath.

        **For Windows:**
        ```sh
        # Compile all Java files, including the JDBC driver in the classpath
        javac -cp ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar" *.java

        # Run the main application
        java -cp ".;sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar" Main
        ```
        **For macOS/Linux:**
        ```sh
        # Compile all Java files, including the JDBC driver in the classpath
        javac -cp ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar" *.java

        # Run the main application
        java -cp ".:sqlite-jdbc-3.27.2.1.jar" Main
        ```
